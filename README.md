# A* search algorithm demo
## About A*
A\* is a grap traversal and path search algorithm. It's often used in many fields of computerscience (e.g. in video games). It's simple and easy to understand.
## Demo
This is my implemantation of this algorithm, based on pseudo-code from [this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
It's has a lot of room for improvement, but it get the job done.
## Requierements
Only module required is pygame.
`pip install pygame`
## Usage
Use `LMB` to draw impassable walls, `RMB` to remove them, `s` to place start, `g` to place goal.  
`r` to start pathfinding. To restart press any of the above.
